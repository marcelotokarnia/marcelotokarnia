I have the most fun while solving architectural problems. Moving the parts around in an efficient, robust and maintainable way.

But of course, you can only trust big changes like this with a fair amount of tests on your code, so I'm a huge fan of automated tests. Some people might even say I'm THAT guy, always commenting on PRs "Do you think you could add a unit test here ?" 😂 If I ever did that to you, I'm sorry, nothing personal, I swear 😂.

Another few comments you can hear from me when talking about Javascript is: `I don't have that problem, Typescript solves it for you`, `I think we can improve the typing here`, `you don't need prop-types if you use Typescript`.

And actually, if you are a beginner/intermediate TS user and want to have a deep dive, I put up this extensive content about my favourite features, its usecases and a list of a few gotchas and how to avoid those. [Check it out.](https://marcelo.tokks.tech/ts)

Enough with work stuff, I have a lot of [personal interests](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/marcelotokarnia/blob/master/personal.md) outside work as well, maybe we share a few in common.
